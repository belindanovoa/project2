Project Description: In our application questions are entered and answered by an online community, and then voted upon. Overall this will connect the online community through communication.

Technical Aspects: Users enter information, and the data is stored. That data will be run into logic where it compares the ratings based off of user votes collectively.

Class Participation: Upon completing the web application the class will get to interact as we demo the product.
